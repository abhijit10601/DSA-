/*
 Problem Description
Given a linked list and an element X, find if there exists a node in the linked list with data equal to X.


Note that input and output are being handled by a main() method behind the scenes, so you do NOT have to implement the main() method or any I/O here.


Youâ€™d have to implement the function defined in the stub, using the arguments, and returning the answer based on the return type of the function.


The structure of the linked list is given as a reference for you while writing the code. Do not make any modifications to it, or any of the rest of the already given stub.


Input format
There are three lines of input.

First line contains N, the size of the linked list.

Next line contains N space separated integers describing the linked list.

Next line contains a single integer X.

Output format
Print "true" if the element is present in the linked list else print "false".

Sample Input 1
5

1 2 3 4 5

2

Sample Output 1
true

Constraints
1 <= N <= 200
