Problem Description
Given a binary tree and an integer k, you need to check whether a node with data k is present in the tree or not.


Note that input and output are being handled by a main() method behind the scenes, so you do NOT have to implement the main() method or any I/O here. The inputs are sent as arguments to the function you have to implement.


Youâ€™d have to implement the function defined in the stub, use the arguments, and return the answer based on the return type of the function.


The structure of the tree is given as a reference for you while writing the code. Do not make any modifications to it, or any of the rest of the stub, or the tests would fail

Input format
There are n+3 lines of input.

First line contains an integer n - Number of nodes.

Second line contains n space separated integers - The value of nodes.

Next n lines contain 3 space separated integers i, l, r describing the left and the right child of ith node as l and r respectively.

Last line contains an integer k - The integer you have to find.

Output format
Return true if k is present, otherwise false.

Sample Input 1
6

4 6 -2 -4 -2 2

1 2 3

2 4 5

4 -1 -1

5 -1 -1

6 -1 -1

2

Sample Output 1
true

Constraints
0 < n < 1000

-10^9 <= Value of nodes <= 10^9

-10^9 <= k <= 10^9
