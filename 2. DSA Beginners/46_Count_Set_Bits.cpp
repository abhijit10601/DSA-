/*
Problem Description
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Hint: To avoid negative values caused by integer overflow, utilize BigInt in your JavaScript code for handling large integer computations.BigInt is a JavaScript built-in object used to represent integers larger than the range supported by the Number primitive.

Input format
Single line containing one 32-bit unsigned integer N.

Output format
Single line containing number of 1 bits in N.

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
Binary representation of 5 is:

101

Hence total number of 1 bits = 2

Constraints
0<=N<=2^32-1

int numberOfOneBits(uint32_t n){
      int c=0;
      while(n){
            if(n&1)c++;
            n=n>>1;
      }
      return c;
 
}
