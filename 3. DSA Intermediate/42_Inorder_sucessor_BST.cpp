/*
Problem Description
Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each parent has a link to its child.

Input format
The tree will be given along with the node for which you have to find the successor.

Q: Q number of queries will be given to you.

Output format
Print the value of the successor node. If it doesnâ€™t exist then print -1.

Sample Input 1
3

5 4 6

0 1 2

1 -1 -1

2 -1 -1

2

2

0

Sample Output 1
-1

6

Explanation 1
The tree given in the sample will look like -

image

There will be no successor of node with value 6.

The successor of node having value 5 will be the node with value 6.

Constraints
1<= Number of nodes <= 20000

1<= Q <= 10000
