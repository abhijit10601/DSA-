Hello Crio Warriors. You don't know me, but I know you and I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose. The question you are looking for is loaded with marks. When the timer in the back goes off, your marks will be permanently ripped off. Here is the question:


All the Bollywood superstars from the likes of Shah Rukh to Amitabh are lining up to entertain our Crio warriors.
